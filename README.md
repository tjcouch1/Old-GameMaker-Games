Archie the Astronaut is an early prototype for a game a couple friends and I planned to make. I made the prototype and the art, and Zachary McCollum made the music. 2013

The quest is my very first GameMaker project! This is the first time I touched coding all the way back in 2009.

Vampire is a stealth AI experiment. I made patroller AI that looks around for the player, goes after him if it sees him, searches the last place it saw him if it loses sight, then returns to its post.
